### Problem 1

The following data frame `df` is constructed using tibble(). It is
comprised of:

-   random sample `norm_samp` of size 10 from a standard Normal
    distribution
-   logical vector `vec_logic` indicating whether elements of the sample
    are greater than 0
-   character vector `vec_char` of length 10
-   factor vector `vec_factor` of length 10, with 3 different factor
    levels `H`,`M` and `L`

``` r
set.seed(1234)
df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_logic = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("H","M","L","L","H","M","L","M","M","H"))
)
```

Taking the mean of each variable in data frame `df`, numeric variable
`norm_samp` has the mean of -0.3831574, and logical vector `vec_logic`
has the mean of 0.4, while for character vector `vec_char` and factor
vector `vec_factor`, taking mean of then will resulted in a warning
message and get `NA` for the mean.

``` r
mean(pull(df,norm_samp))
## [1] -0.3831574
mean(pull(df,vec_logic))
## [1] 0.4
mean(pull(df,vec_char))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or logical:
## returning NA
## [1] NA
mean(pull(df,vec_factor))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
## [1] NA
```

Using `as.numeric` function to the logical, character, and factor
variables, logical variable `vec_logic` was converted to numeric numbers
`0` and `1`, with original argument `FALSE` being converted to `0` and
`TRUE` to `1`; factor vector `vec_factor` was also converted to numeric,
with the 3 levels being converted to `1`, `2` and `3`, while character
vector `vec_char` cannot be converted.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df,vec_logic))
as.numeric(pull(df,vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(df,vec_factor))
```

This may because logical and factor variables stand for 2 or several
categories and have limited numbers of value. logical values have only
two values `TRUE` and `FALSE`, which can be easily encoded into `1` and
`0`. And it is reasonable and somewhat instinct to take a mean of the
encoded values – reflecting the fraction of `TRUE`(`1`) among all
values.

Factor variables should also have a predefined number of categories, and
thus can be converted into the same amount of integers to present.
However, factor values may or may not have levels and orders, and it’s
meaningless to take mean to the encoded values if there’s no order.

For character variables, the value can be arbitrary input and can be
infinite, and they don’t have orders, so it’s difficult and meaningless
to represent them as numeric values.
